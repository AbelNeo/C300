      <strong>Arsenal FC</strong>, based in North London, is one of the most iconic football clubs in the world. Founded in 1886, the Gunners have a rich history marked by legendary managers like Herbert Chapman and Arsène Wenger, the latter of whom led the club through the famous 2003–04 “Invincibles” season—an undefeated Premier League campaign.
